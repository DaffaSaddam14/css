                        Lorem ipsum, in graphical and textual context,

                        or visual presentation. Lorem ipsum is derived from 
                        the Latin "dolorem ipsum" roughly translated as 
                       "pain itself." Lorem ipsum presents the sample font

                        applications where content is not the main concern 
                        of the developer.
